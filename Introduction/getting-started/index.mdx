# Getting Started

Ready to write your first line of D3? Let's get your environment set up.

### Installation

The easiest way to include D3 in your project is via NPM:

```bash
npm install d3
```

Or, if you just want to experiment in a single HTML file, you can load it from a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>
```

### Your Initial Setup

In this course, we will heavily use the **Live Playground**. It's pre-configured with D3 v7, so you don't even need to install anything to follow along!

### Basic Selection

The first step in any D3 project is selecting an element to work with:

```javascript
// Select the body and change its background color
d3.select("body").style("background-color", "black");
```
