# Prerequisite

Before we start binding data and drawing circles, let's make sure our foundation is solid.

### 1. Basic JavaScript (ES6)

You don't need to be a JS wizard, but you should be comfortable with:

- Variables (`const`, `let`)
- Functions and Arrow Functions
- Arrays & Objects (and methods like `.map()`, `.filter()`)
- Promises and `async/await` (for loading data)

### 2. HTML & CSS

Knowledge of the DOM (Document Object Model) and how to style elements with CSS will make your D3 journey much smoother.

### 3. Basic Math

A little bit of geometry and algebra helps with layouts, but don't worry—D3 handles the heavy lifting of coordinate calculations for you!
