# What about the robots?

In the age of AI and automated charting tools, you might wonder: **Why learn D3?**

Can't we just ask a robot to "make me a bar chart"? While AI is great at generating boilerplate code, data visualization is as much about **storytelling** and **precision** as it is about code.

### The Human Touch

D3 allows you to create visualizations that are:

- **Unique**: Move beyond standard templates.
- **Explainable**: You know exactly why every pixel is where it is.
- **Interactive**: Create custom behaviors that LLMs haven't seen before.

We aren't just drawing charts; we are building mental models for our users. Robots can help us write the SVG paths, but we decide the narrative.
